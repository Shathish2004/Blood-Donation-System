## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep rose (#C72E5A) evoking a sense of care and urgency, without being as literal as red.
- Background color: Light pale rose (#F4E5E9) for a calming, supportive backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale purple (#957DAD) as a contrasting accent that provides visual interest without clashing.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clear readability and a modern yet accessible feel.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different blood types, institutions, and actions. Consistent styling is key.
- Maintain a clean, user-friendly layout with clear hierarchy. Prioritize ease of navigation for all user types (donors, individuals, hospitals, blood banks).
- Use subtle animations to indicate status changes (e.g., availability updates, request confirmations) without distracting from the user experience.
